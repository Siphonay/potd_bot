# potd_bot
Pok√©mon of the Day bot for Mastodon

usage: run `potd_bot.rb` as a cron job with environment variable for your Mastodon instance, your access token, your app name and website. You can find the variable names to use in the file.

Thanks to [codl](https://github.com/codl) for improving the bot and fixing my bad code
